# Team Profile Generator

The Team Profile generator is a **command-line interface (CLI)** application built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm package Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for testing. This application allows users to generate an HTML file with information about their team members. The user is prompted with a series of questions to fill out information such as the team member's name, id, email, office number, Github username, and school they attended. Once all the required information is provided, the application will generate an HTML file that displays all the team member's information. The generated file will eb saved in the **output** directory. 

This application is a great tool for anyone looking to easily create a professional-looking team profile.
